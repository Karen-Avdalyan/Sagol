    "faq_text0": "Do the reflectors need cleaning?",
    "faq_desc0": "These reflectors do not need cleaning as part of their normal operation, however cleaning is recommended in case of hand contact with a UVC lamp during installation. In this case, use 99% pure alcohol and a clean cloth.",
    "faq_text1": "Should UVC lamps work in cycles with the air circulation blower in continuousky work or, the air conditioner? ",
    "faq_desc1": "It is recommended that the UVC lamps operate continuously because the organisms they treat multiply continuously.",
    "faq_text2": "Is the UVC system harmful?",
    "faq_desc2": "UVC radiation is dangerous only under direct and prolonged exposure. Because the device is assembled in an air-conditioned system and/or protected to prevent exposure.The use of protective glasses and gloves is recommended as a protective measure during installation to protect the eyes and skin.Our company specializes in safe and careful installation, for example: using a safety switch that turns off the system as soon as the HITA door is opened and sticking warning stickers on all the service doors.",
    "faq_text3": "How will you know it actually works?",
    "faq_desc3": "There are several ways to prove the operation of the lamps: one way is to use a petri dish (a plate with a substrate for bacterial culture) before the process of installing UVC lamps, sixty days after installing the UVC lamps we will repeat the same process and compare results.A drastic and visible decrease will be seen after a short period of time: the air flow in the system will increase as a result, the water drainage trays will be significantly cleaner, the surface of the system will look like new, most of the odors in the air space will disappear and the air will have a feeling of freshness.",
    "faq_text4": "What are the operating limitations under temperature, humidity and speed wind?",
    "faq_desc4": "The limitations are: between  0-77৹C , relative humidity of  99% , wind speed of 1000 feet per minute respectively.",
    "faq_text5": "Is it necessary to clean the battery beforehead?",
    "faq_desc5": "UVC will break down the organic materials that are on and with the battery, usually within a period of 8 to 10 weeks.Early cleaning of the battery will shorten the period and UVC lamps will keep the clean state.",
    "faq_text6": "Is it supported to replace the filters?",
    "faq_desc6": "No. The UVC device is another component within the air conditioning system (batteries, evaporators, filters, etc.).",

    "product_litva_desc": "The SANUVOX IL series UVC lamp system for cleaning the evaporator coil is a patent designed and designed to eliminate and prevent molds and other microorganisms from developing and growing on the evaporator coil and the surrounding environment.",
    "product_litva_desc1": "The 'profits' include the elimination and elimination of the 'carrying' of molds, bacteria, viruses, spores and odors by the breeze into the buildings, by regular and continuous activity of cleaning the evaporator battery and eliminating the need for conventional and ineffective cleaning methods over time such as chemical substances.",
    "product_litva_desc2": "For the most part, biofilm (the same black coating based on sugars and proteins that forms on the leaves of the evaporator battery), which coats the leaves of the evaporator, lowers the efficiency of heat transfer and affects the efficiency of the evaporator battery. The IL series UVC lamp system maintains maximum cleanliness of the battery, increases the usefulness of the battery and its results, extends the life of the battery and allows it to work with optimal efficiency while saving energy.",
    "product_litva_desc3": "The IL series UVC lamp system is equipped with a high-power 19 mm quartz lamp, a high-power electronic starter and transformer system, and an anodized reflector, creating an exceptionally efficient and undisputed category-leading system.",
    "product_litva_desc4": "By using an anodized drawn aluminum reflector, the SUNUVOX evaporator coil cleaning and purification system can concentrate all the UVC energy into the evaporator coil without wasting energy in the surrounding directions unnecessarily while losing lamp energy (for example: a car's front windshield reflector). The reflector also creates protection for plastic parts and wiring against the destructive UVC rays. Using lamps and other fixtures will result in wasting more than half of the UVC energy.",
    "product_litva_character1": "Elimination of molds and the development or other microbiological growths in the evaporator battery, at the same time as elimination of biological odors generated by the battery.",
    "product_litva_character2": "Improving and saving energy and lowering maintenance costs of the evaporator battery.",
    "product_litva_character3": "A lamp in a variety of sizes up to 152 cm long.",
    "product_litva_character4": "UVC lamp made of quartz 19 mm in diameter, with high power.",
    "product_litva_character5": "Option - LED control located in the choke/transformer diagnoses and analyzes the performance of the lamp and its condition, and informs the user about the timing of lamp replacement.",
    "product_litva_character6": "Option - 'dry contact' is included, which allows the UVC lamp system to be integrated into the building's automatic control system.",
    "product_litva_character7": "A special UVC resistant cover seals and protects the connections of the UVC lamps against moisture and humidity.",
    "product_litva_character8": "Exclusive patent of the UVC system to enhance the efficiency of UVC radiation.",
    "product_litva_character9": "Utilization of UVC energy while protecting plastic components from destructive UVC rays.",
    "product_litva_character10": "High and very reliable radiation level, compared to competing systems of UVC lamps, choke / transformer installed outside the HITA unit (air treatment unit).",
    "product_litva_character11": "Long-term warranty, 10 years for the choke/transformer, two years warranty for the lamp.",
    "product_litva_character12": "UVC lamp life is longer 17000 hours compared to 8000 of competitors.",

    "product_air_desc": "A system of lamps for the treatment of canals",
    "product_air_desc1": "The 'UVC barrier' for living organisms and organic materials is a Sanuvox patent that actually produces a 'protective barrier' from UV energy that eliminates and disables biological and chemical pollutants, diseases and allergenic substances as well as neutralizes unpleasant odors present in the air around us.",
    "product_air_desc2": "The system contains several quartz lamps that produce very high intensity UVC radiation.",
    "product_air_desc3": "These lamps are mounted on anodized aluminum reflectors, which concentrate highly focused radiation at 360 degrees, which kills bacteria and odors.",
    "product_air_desc4": "Two types of devices exist:   UV BIO-WALL MAX  and  QUATTRO LIGHT which are  installed parallel to the air flow in order to expose those pollutants to UV energy as long as possible.",
    "product_air_desc5": "The devices have a control display, which is installed inside the choke/transformer box of the unit, and includes: digital control of the system's working hours and warning control for lamp malfunction. It is also possible to connect to a computerized control system (building control).",
    "product_air_desc6": "The type of device and the length of the bulbs depend on the physical size of the air conditioning duct, the speed of the air in it, the quality/intensity of the pollutants and odors that are required for treatment, the percentage of elimination and the shutdown requested by the customer (maximum bulb length 152 cm).",
    "product_air_character1": "Lowering the distribution percentage of pollutants in the air, morbidity in buildings, reducing absenteeism while creating a significant improvement in air quality.",
    "product_air_character2": "Maintenance and care of the air conditioning duct in a continuous manner.",
    "product_air_character3": "Elimination of up to 99.999% of chemical and biological pollutants.",
